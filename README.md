# Boxing Landing Page

boxing site based off a theme provided in udemy course Advanced CSS by Jonas Schmedtmann

Revamped some of the styles, custom images, and completed the mobile efforts on my own. 
Optimized for across the board experience, and will implement javascript so buttons and navigation work as intended.

Also intend to implement browser caching so I get better performance review via Service Workers. 

Currently sitting around an 88 score based on pingdom.com

Work in progress and not finalized nor commercial.
